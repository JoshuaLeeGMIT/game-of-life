        <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional
        orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible
        states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).
        Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells
        that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step
        in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first
        generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every
        cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete
        moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation
        is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied
        repeatedly to create further generations.</p>

        <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, a model that can trace
        its origins back to the ideas of John Von Neumann in the late 1940s. John Conway
        began devising and refining the set of rules for his game in 1968 and it
        was published in the October 1970 issue of <i>Scientific American</i>, quickly
        drawing attention from mathematicians and computer scientists alike.</p>
        <p>First simulated on paper and a Go board, programmers were quick to notice
        the potential to program it for computers.</p>
